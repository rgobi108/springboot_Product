# springboot_Product
This Spring Boot project is designed to manage product details using an H2 database and Spring Boot's JPA (Java Persistence API) repository. It allows users to perform two main operations:

1. **Add Product:** Users can add new product details to the database. This involves capturing information such as product name, description, price, and any other relevant attributes.

2. **Get Product Details:** Users can retrieve product details from the database. This operation enables fetching information about a specific product using its unique identifier.

The project utilizes Spring Boot's built-in capabilities for handling database interactions, making use of the H2 database, an in-memory database often used for development and testing purposes. JPA repository is employed to simplify database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing seamless integration between the application code and the database.

Overall, this Spring Boot project provides a user-friendly and efficient way to manage and access product details using the H2 database and Spring Boot's JPA repository functionality.
